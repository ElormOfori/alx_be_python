# Step 1: Define the variables
principal = 1000  # principal amount in dollars($)
rate = 0.05       # annual interest rate as a decimal (5%)
time = 3          # time in years

# Step 2: Calculate the simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Step 3: Print the calculated interest
print(f"The simple interest is: [{interest}]")
